# TXP-XML-Parser

### A fast and tiny XML parser

This project is under construction. More features coming.

To see an interactive example just execute run.sh, but you will also need the Deno runtime (https://deno.land/)


### Current status:
- Works with all(?) valid XML files (utf-8 BOM not supported yet)
- Big files should be no problem (very fast processing, tested with 21000 nodes)
- Full support for XML attributes
- Partial support for CDATA sections (accepted, but no special processing yet)


If you should find any issues, just let me know (preferably over Twitter or E-Mail).
